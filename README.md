## Workshop Agenda

  1. Overview of Git + files and views

  3. Creating or cloning a repository (git-init/git-clone)
  4. Staging (git-add) and commiting files (git-commit)
  5. Viewing, traversing, and tagging history (git-log, git-checkout, git-tag)
  6. Alternate histories: git-branch
  7. Manipulating history: git-merge, git-cherry-pick, git-rebase
  8. Working remotely and collaboratively: GitHub, git-push/git-pull

This repository will contain files for a workshop on Git; I have other materials
floating around (such as on my [wiki](http://wiki.karlstolley.com/GitTutorial)
and my [course websites](http://courses.karlstolley.com/530/GitFu). But I'm
finally getting around to condensing that work into one place. Here.
