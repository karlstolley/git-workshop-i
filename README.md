# Distributed Version Control with Git
_A 75-minute workshop for the un_```init```_iated_.

floating around (such as on my [http://wiki.karlstolley.com/GitTutorial](wiki)
and my [http://courses.karlstolley.com/530/GitFu](course websites). But I'm
finally getting around to condensing that work into one place. Here.
